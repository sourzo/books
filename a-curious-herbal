Transcriber note: I've converted several typographical artifacts for ease of reading: the long-s becomes a regular s; y^e (þe) becomes 'the', and Iune and Iuly are written as June and July. Please excuse any errors in transcribing the Greek. Some of the translations have [blank] - this is where there was a blank space in the book. Perhaps they didn't have the translation and saved a space for it.
